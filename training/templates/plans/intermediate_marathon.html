      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Answers to common questions about generating and using your intermediate marathon training plan.</p>
      <h3>How do I choose the right training distance?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Select the race distance you are preparing for. The intermediate marathon plan is designed specifically for the marathon distance. Training for a marathon requires a structured approach to ensure you build up the necessary endurance and speed over time.</p>
      <h3>How many weeks should I train?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>We offer plans ranging from 16 to 22 weeks. Choose the duration that fits your schedule and training level. More weeks allow for a more gradual build-up and better adaptation, which can help reduce the risk of injury and improve your overall performance.</p>
      <h3>What if I need to change the units?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>You can choose between miles and kilometers in the "Unit" dropdown. The training plan will adjust accordingly, ensuring that you are comfortable with the units used for your training runs and can accurately track your progress.</p>
      <h3>What if I miss a week?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you miss a week, don't try to make up all the missed workouts. Continue with your plan, and adjust the intensity if necessary. It's better to progress steadily than risk injury by overtraining. Missing a week is not ideal, but it's important to focus on consistency and avoid burnout.</p>
      <h3>Can I download or email my training plan?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Yes! After generating your plan, you can download it as a PDF or send it to your email using the provided buttons. This makes it easy to access your plan on the go and stay organized throughout your training.</p>
      <h3>What if I'm looking for a more challenging plan?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you're looking for more difficult training plans, check out our advanced marathon training plan. These plans include additional workouts and higher mileage to help you reach your goals. Advanced plans are designed for runners who have experience and are looking to push their limits further.</p>
