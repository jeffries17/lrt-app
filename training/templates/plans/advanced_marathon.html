    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Answers to common questions about generating and using your advanced marathon training plan.</p>
    <h3>How does the advanced marathon training plan work?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This plan includes a mix of easy runs, long runs, speed work, and strength training designed to push your limits and improve your performance. It's designed for experienced runners who have a solid base and are looking to reach new personal bests.</p>
    <h3>How many weeks should I train?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We offer plans ranging from 16 to 22 weeks. Choose the duration that fits your schedule and training level. More weeks allow for a more gradual build-up and better adaptation, which can help reduce the risk of injury and improve your overall performance.</p>
    <h3>What if I need to change the units?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You can choose between miles and kilometers in the "Unit" dropdown. The training plan will adjust accordingly, ensuring that you are comfortable with the units used for your training runs and can accurately track your progress.</p>
    <h3>What if I miss a week?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>If you miss a week, don't try to make up all the missed workouts. Continue with your plan, and adjust the intensity if necessary. It's better to progress steadily than risk injury by overtraining. Missing a week is not ideal, but it's important to focus on long-term consistency.</p>
    <h3>Can I download or email my training plan?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Yes! After generating your plan, you can download it as a PDF or send it to your email using the provided buttons. This makes it easy to access your plan on the go and stay organized throughout your training.</p>
    <h3>What if I need additional support?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>If you need additional support, consider hiring a coach or joining a running group. They can provide personalized guidance and help you stay motivated. Additionally, our advanced plans are designed to be adaptable, so feel free to make adjustments based on your personal needs and feedback.</p>
