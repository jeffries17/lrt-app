      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>What is base-building?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Base-building is the process of gradually increasing your weekly mileage to improve your overall endurance and running fitness. It's an essential phase for runners looking to prepare for more intense training or longer races.</p>
      <h3>How does this plan work?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This 12-week plan is designed to increase your weekly mileage by approximately 25 miles (or equivalent in km) from your starting point. The increase is gradual to reduce the risk of injury and allow your body to adapt to the higher training volume.</p>
      <h3>Is this plan suitable for beginners?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This plan is most suitable for runners who already have a consistent running base and are looking to increase their mileage. If you're new to running, consider starting with a beginner's plan that focuses on run/walk intervals and building consistency.</p>
      <h3>What if I miss a run?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you miss a run, don't try to make it up by adding extra miles to your next run. Simply continue with the plan as scheduled. Consistency is key in base-building, but occasional missed runs won't derail your progress.</p>
      <h3>Should I do any speed work during base-building?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This plan focuses primarily on easy-paced running to build endurance safely. However, you can incorporate light strides or fartlek runs once a week if you feel comfortable. Avoid high-intensity speed work during this phase.</p>
