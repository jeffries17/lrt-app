    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Answers to common questions about generating and using your ultramarathon training plan.</p>
    <h3>How do I choose the right training distance?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Select the race distance you are preparing for. If you are training for a non-standard distance, select "Custom" and enter the distance in the provided field. Choosing the right distance is crucial as it helps tailor your training to match the specific demands of your race.</p>
    <h3>How many weeks should I train?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We offer plans ranging from 16 to 22 weeks. Choose the duration that fits your schedule and training level. More weeks allow for a more gradual build-up and better adaptation, which is essential for avoiding injuries and ensuring a successful race.</p>
    <h3>What if I need to change the units?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>You can choose between miles and kilometers in the "Unit" dropdown. The training plan will adjust accordingly. This flexibility ensures that your training is consistent with your preferred measurement system, making it easier to track your progress.</p>
    <h3>What if I miss a week?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>If you miss a week, don't try to make up all the missed workouts. Continue with your plan, and adjust the intensity if necessary. It's better to progress steadily than risk injury by overtraining. Missing a week is not the end of the world, and with proper adjustments, you can stay on track.</p>
    <h3>Can I download or email my training plan?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Yes! After generating your plan, you can download it as a PDF or send it to your email using the provided buttons. This feature ensures that you have easy access to your plan wherever you are, whether offline or on the go.</p>
