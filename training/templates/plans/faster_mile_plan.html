  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>How does the plan generator work?</h3>
  <p>The plan generator uses your current mile time to create a training plan aimed at improving your mile time by 5%. The plan includes specific interval workouts with target paces for 400m, 800m, and 1200m intervals based on your goal time.</p>
  
  <h3>Who is this plan for?</h3>
  <p>This plan is designed for runners who want to improve their mile time. It is suitable for runners of all levels, whether you are a beginner looking to make significant improvements or an experienced runner aiming to shave off a few seconds.</p>
  
  <h3>How often should I follow the training plan?</h3>
  <p>The training plan typically includes several workouts per week. Consistency is key to improvement, so try to follow the plan as closely as possible. Ensure you balance hard workouts with easier runs and rest days to avoid overtraining and injuries.</p>
  
  <h3>Can I adjust the plan if I miss a workout?</h3>
  <p>Yes, the plan can be adjusted if you miss a workout. It is important to listen to your body and not try to make up missed workouts by overloading yourself. Continue with the plan as best as you can and maintain a balance between training and recovery.</p>
  
  <h3>What should I do if I don't see improvements?</h3>
  <p>If you are not seeing improvements, evaluate your training consistency, nutrition, sleep, and recovery strategies. Consider consulting with a coach or experienced runner for personalized advice. Sometimes, small adjustments in your training approach can lead to significant improvements.</p>
