    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Answers to common questions about generating and using your intermediate half marathon training plan.</p>
    <h3>How does the intermediate half marathon training plan work?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This plan includes a mix of easy runs, long runs, and speed work each week, with rest days to allow for recovery. It's designed to help you build endurance and speed gradually while avoiding injury. The focus is on consistency and progression.</p>
    <h3>How many weeks should I train?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>We offer plans ranging from 8 to 16 weeks. Choose the duration that fits your schedule and training level. More weeks allow for a more gradual build-up and better adaptation, which is especially important for avoiding overtraining and injuries.</p>
    <h3>What if I miss a week?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>If you miss a week, don't try to make up all the missed workouts. Continue with your plan, and adjust the intensity if necessary. It's better to progress steadily than risk injury by overtraining. Missing a week is not ideal, but it's important to focus on long-term consistency.</p>
    <h3>Can I download or email my training plan?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Yes! After generating your plan, you can download it as a PDF or send it to your email using the provided buttons. This makes it easy to access your plan on the go and stay organized throughout your training.</p>
    <h3>What if I'm looking for a more challenging plan?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>If you're looking for more difficult training plans, check out our advanced half marathon training plans. These plans include additional workouts and higher mileage to help you reach your goals. They are designed for runners who have some experience and are looking to push their limits further.</p>
