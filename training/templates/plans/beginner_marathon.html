      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Answers to common questions about generating and using your beginner marathon training plan.</p>
      <h3>How does the beginner marathon training plan work?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>This plan includes easy runs and a long run each week, with rest days in between to allow for recovery. It's designed to help you build endurance gradually while avoiding injury. The focus is on consistency and gradual progression.</p>
      <h3>How many weeks should I train?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>We offer plans ranging from 16 to 22 weeks. Choose the duration that fits your schedule and training level. More weeks allow for a more gradual build-up and better adaptation, which is especially important for beginners to avoid overtraining and injuries.</p>
      <h3>What if I miss a week?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you miss a week, don't try to make up all the missed workouts. Continue with your plan, and adjust the intensity if necessary. It's better to progress steadily than risk injury by overtraining. Missing a week is not ideal, but it's important to focus on long-term consistency.</p>
      <h3>Can I download or email my training plan?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Yes! After generating your plan, you can download it as a PDF or send it to your email using the provided buttons. This makes it easy to access your plan on the go and stay organized throughout your training.</p>
      <h3>What if I'm looking for a more challenging plan?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you're looking for more difficult training plans, check out our intermediate and advanced marathon training plans. These plans include additional workouts and higher mileage to help you reach your goals. They are designed for runners who have some experience and are looking to push their limits further.</p>
