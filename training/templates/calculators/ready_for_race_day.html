        <h3>How does the calculator work?</h3>
        <p>The calculator evaluates your readiness for a marathon based on the number of weeks until the race, your current weekly mileage, and other relevant factors. It provides insights into whether your current training is sufficient to meet your race goals.</p>

        <h3>What is considered a good weekly mileage?</h3>
        <p>A good weekly mileage depends on your running experience and goals. Generally, beginners should aim for 20-30 miles per week, while more experienced runners can aim for 35-50 miles or more. This ensures a solid base for marathon training.</p>

        <h3>How accurate is the readiness assessment?</h3>
        <p>The readiness assessment provides a general guideline based on typical training requirements. It should be used as a tool to help you plan your training, but individual needs may vary. Always listen to your body and adjust your training as needed.</p>

        <h3>Can I improve my readiness if I have fewer weeks until the race?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can improve your readiness by gradually increasing your weekly mileage and incorporating different types of training runs. However, avoid increasing mileage too quickly to prevent injuries. Consistent training over time yields the best results.</p>

        <h3>What should I do if I'm not ready for the race?</h3>
        <p>If you're not ready for the race, consider postponing to a later date or focusing on shorter races to build up your endurance and experience. Alternatively, adjust your race goals to match your current fitness level.</p>
