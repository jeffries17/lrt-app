  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h3>How does the calculator work?</h3>
  <p>The calculator estimates your finish time based on your entered pace per mile or kilometer. It adjusts the pace to show variations, helping you plan your race strategy effectively.</p>

  <h3>Who can use this calculator?</h3>
  <p>This tool is designed for runners of all levels who want to estimate their race finish times based on their expected pace. It is suitable for training and race day planning.</p>

  <h3>What distances does the calculator cover?</h3>
  <p>The calculator covers a wide range of distances, including common race distances like 5K, 10K, half marathon, and marathon, as well as custom distances up to 31 miles or 50 kilometers.</p>

  <h3>Why are there pace variations in the table?</h3>
  <p>The pace variations (-10s, -5s, +5s, +10s) provide a range of estimated finish times. This helps you understand how slight changes in your pace can impact your overall time.</p>

  <h3>How accurate are the results?</h3>
  <p>The results are based on the entered pace and distance. Actual race times may vary due to factors like terrain, weather, and your physical condition on race day. Use the results as an estimate and adjust your training accordingly.</p>
