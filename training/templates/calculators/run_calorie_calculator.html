          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>This calculator helps you estimate the calories burned during your run, incorporating several key factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Calories burned are directly proportional to the body weight of the runner. We use your weight to calculate the total energy expenditure, converting pounds to kilograms if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The longer the distance, the more calories burned. This input adjusts the energy cost proportionally to the distance covered.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Total time spent running also affects calorie burn. We break down the input into hours, minutes, and seconds to compute the energy expenditure accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> Running uphill increases the energy cost significantly due to the additional effort required to overcome gravity. Elevation is optional and can be specified in meters or feet.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>How does the calculator work?</h3>
        <p>The calculator estimates the calories burned during your run based on your weight, the distance covered, the duration of the run, and the elevation gain. These factors are combined using standard formulas to provide an estimate of your energy expenditure.</p>

        <h3>Why do I need to enter my weight?</h3>
        <p>Your weight is a critical factor in determining the number of calories burned. Heavier individuals burn more calories per unit of distance compared to lighter individuals. This ensures the estimate is personalized to your specific body metrics.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't know the elevation gain?</h3>
        <p>Elevation gain is optional. If you don't know the elevation gain, you can leave it blank, and the calculator will estimate calories burned on flat terrain. Including elevation provides a more accurate estimate if you run on hilly or mountainous routes.</p>

        <h3>How accurate is the calorie estimation?</h3>
        <p>The estimation provides a general guideline based on standard formulas. Individual variations can occur, so consider this as an approximate estimate rather than an exact value. Factors such as metabolism, running efficiency, and environmental conditions can affect actual calorie burn.</p>

        <h3>Can I use this calculator for other activities?</h3>
        <p>This calculator is specifically designed for running. Different activities have different energy expenditure rates, so the results may not be accurate for other activities. Use calculators tailored to specific activities for more accurate estimates.</p>
