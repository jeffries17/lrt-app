          <h2>About Heart Rate Training Zones</h2>
          <p>Heart rate training zones are critical for maximizing the efficiency of your training, tailored to your fitness goals such as weight loss or improving endurance. Each zone represents a different intensity level that affects how calories are burned and how your cardiovascular fitness improves.</p>
          <p>Use this calculator to find your heart rate zones by entering your age, maximum, and resting heart rates.</p>

        <h3>How does the calculator work?</h3>
        <p>The calculator determines your heart rate zones based on your maximum and resting heart rates. These zones help you tailor your training to meet your fitness goals.</p>

        <h3>What is the importance of heart rate training zones?</h3>
        <p>Heart rate training zones allow you to train at different intensities, helping you improve endurance, speed, and overall cardiovascular fitness.</p>

        <h3>How accurate are the results?</h3>
        <p>The results provide a general guideline based on common formulas for calculating heart rate zones. Individual variations may occur, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional.</p>

        <h3>What if I don't know my maximum heart rate?</h3>
        <p>If you don't know your maximum heart rate, the calculator uses the standard formula of 220 minus your age to estimate it.</p>

        <h3>How should I use my heart rate zones?</h3>
        <p>Use your heart rate zones to guide your training intensity. For example, Zone 1 is for recovery, while Zone 5 is for high-intensity efforts.</p>
